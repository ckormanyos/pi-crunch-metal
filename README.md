# pi-crunch-metal
Computes a million digits of pi on selected bare-metal microcontroller systems.

This fascinating, educational and fun project combines the domain
of high-performance numerical computing with the raw simplicity of
bare-metal embedded microcontroller systems.

Exihbiting the utmost in portability realized through modern header-only C++11
template code, pi-crunch-metal is intended to run out of the box on both
a PC system as well as selected bare-metal microcontroller systems.
